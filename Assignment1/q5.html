        <p><u>The Psychology of Money</u>-The field of <em><strong>finance</strong></em>, including investment, personal <em><strong>finance</strong></em>, and <em><strong>business</strong></em> decisions, is typically presented as a <em><strong>mathematical</strong></em> one, where we are given <em><strong>precise</strong></em> instructions based on data and formulas. However, people in the real world don't use spreadsheets to make <em><strong>important</strong></em> financial decisions. At the dinner table or in the conference room, people mix in their own backgrounds, perspectives, egos, prides, marketing strategies, and <em><strong>peculiar</strong></em> motivations to come up with these decisions.To help you better understand one of life's most important themes, <em><strong>award-winning</strong></em> author <u>Morgan Housel</u> presents 19 short stories in his book The Psychology of Money.</p>
